How it works
------------

This book is written using a static blog generator called
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  Each chapter is treated like a blog post and
all of the posts together make up the book.  Each post is written in
plain-text and then Jekyll does the work of making an HTML website from the
plain text posts.

The HTML site is actually compiled and published by
[GitHub](http://github.com) using their GitHub Pages.  Initially conceived as
a way for software projects to publish documentation, GitHub Pages use Jekyll
to compile a special branch of a software project and publish the resulting
site on <http://github.io>.  In the case of this book project, there is no
software project to go with it and it purely consists of the documentation
branch.
