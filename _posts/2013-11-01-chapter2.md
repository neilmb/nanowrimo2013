The number from the ad hadn't rung more than half a ring before the elegant
voice of an older lady answered "Hello, Suffolk residence".  A bit startled,
since he had been wardriving for a cell phone signal and hadn't expected to
actually be connected this soon, Chip stammered his reply, "Yes, I'm calling
about your ad looking for computer help".

"Ah, yes, do you think you could help me?"

Since he had no idea what it was she needed help with, Chip decided to play it
cool "I'm pretty sure I can figure it out.  What kind of problems are you
having?"

"I think that I might have some kind of computer flu."

"Virus?"

"Oh, yes, my mistake, that is what they call it."

Not looking forward to removing the malware from some grandmother's ancient
Pentium 3 desktop, but desperate for some positive rate of change in his cash
position, Chip offered to come over and take a look.  He didn't know anything
about being a freelancer yet, so once he hung up the phone, he felt like an
idiot for not getting some agreement on what his rate would be.  Of course, he
didn't have any idea what his rate would be, so at least the drive would give
him some time to figure it out.

He tried to pull up the address on Google Now, but apparently Sand Hill
sounds too much like "sandal" and he had no luck on the voice recognition for
Sand Hill Road.  Violating numerous state laws against texting while driving
and the new federal ban on distracted driving, Chip slewed across the gravel
in what he thought was going to be the right way out of town while he waited
for the 1G cell service to pull up the map.  As it happened, he had chosen the
right road out of town and he avoided the dreaded "recalculating" from the GPS
lady's voice.

Passing through corn and soybean fields barren and brown after their autumn
shave, Chip headed his little plug-in hybrid further up the draw alongside a
drippy creek and up the slope of what he assumed was Sand Hill.  The road
continued up and back for a surprisingly long way out of town, necessitating
another law-defying check on his smartphone to see what distance it would be
until the next change of direction.  Finally, the voice announced that his
destination was on the right but that seemed highly doubtful since the only
thing on his right was a tall limestone bluff that seemed to tower coldly over
the little car.  But, to GPS lady's credit, there was a narrow driveway marked
with a reflective 911 sign whose number matched the one he had gotten from
Mrs. Suffolk on the phone.

The narrow drive wound along the side of the bluff until it switchbacked on
top of itself at the top and revealed a stunning vista looking out over the
woodlands in the river bottoms and the tan monotony of the fallow fields on
the high ground.  The landscape looked as smooth as cheap polyester office
carpet that had been maniacally scored by the action action of water and trees
as if by some giant, disgruntled employee misusing a pair of stockroom
scissors.  To the west, the afternoon sun was coming down onto the high ground
on the other side of the creek, while behind to the east, the top of the bluff
capered along in the waving stalks of prairie grasses intermixed with rock
outcroppings.

To his left, at the end of the drive was a small, unpainted board-and-batten
cabin of the type favored by 1960s era immigrants to the area.  He knew that
the almost featureless northern side that he was staring at would be mirrored
by a large sun-gathering wall of windows on the south facing exposure once he
got done with the mundanities of finding a likely spot of dead grass to park
on.  Walking to the front door (or as the resident probably considered it the
back door since it only faced the road, not the splendor of nature), Chip
admired the tall plantings of native coneflowers and sunflowers beside the
walk, urban gardens be damned.

When he knocked, the door was answered by a graying woman in a worn woolen
shirt over a gingham dress.  

"You must be Chip, please come in."

The voice was surprisingly cultured for its weathered surroundings.  Chip
gaped a bit at the timber-framed cathedral ceilings opening onto the
anticipated southern exposure, his mind still unaccustomed to the vastness of
the landscape outside the windows.  Free from the fuzzy green coating that the
Earth enjoyed around Portland, the land appeared almost naked under its thin
winter shift.  Chip noted that the smooth tan of farm fields was broken with
one jagged square of an almost white grey that nearly dominated one side of
the field of view.

"Is that a quarry?"

"It was.  There hasn't been mining there for many years and there's a small
pond at the bottom of the quarry now."

Seating him at the sturdy but scarred dining room table, his hostess proferred
a teapot under a cozy and Chip assented with a nod of his head that he hoped
was polite enough by old lady standards.

"Thank you Mrs. Suffolk."

"Please Chip, you can call me Ellen.  I haven't been Mrs. Suffolk since I
retired from teaching."

Content with telling the story of his unprodigal return while he sipped the
lemon balm tea, it was only when he reached the bottom of his first cup that
he began to inquire about the purpose of his visit.  Still shy about what he
was going to get for his service, he asked "Did you say that you had a
computer with a communicable disease in here?"

"I'm sorry, I was presuming on your company.  Let me show you to the computer
room."

Completely demolishing his preconceptions of what computer problems a retired
schoolteacher might have, Ellen led Chip down the stairs into a basement
computer room that would have been right at home at Pixar or YouTube.  There
were dual 32-inch monitors  and a sleek wireless keyboard on the desk while
the slatey grey towers were tucked neatly under the desk.  The walls were
covered in a veritable museum exhibit of video interchange devices.  From old
celluloid film reels in metal canisters, they wrapped around through VHS and
DV tapes, on to CDs and DVDs in meticulously labeled plastic jewel cases.
The last shelf ended with a row of hard disk drives in identical USB
enclosures.  One of those enclosures was winking away on the surface of the desk
by the two large screens.

A bit taken aback, she noticed Chip's reaction and tried to explain.  "I've
always been interested in amateur film making.  I started out taking 8
millimeter films of my kids and it sort of blossomed from there.  Since I
retired, I've been adding to my digital equipment whenever I can.  I can get
my head around the video software because I can just think of it like an edit
deck from my film-strip cutting days, but I'm useless with anything else on
the computer."

With the invitation implicit in her apology, Chip slid into the large black
leather office chair in front of the keyboard and mindlessly adjusted the
knobs for better ergonomics.  When you've worked at as many coding jobs as he had,
you knew where the adjustments were on every brand of chair and you knew to
make use of them to save your wrists.  Wiggling the mouse, an unfamiliar login
screen presented itself.

"What sort of system is this, then?" he asked, feeling growing dread that his
breezy confidence on the phone was going to be misplaced.

"It's just a Windows machine, but until yesterday I'd never seen that box
before."
