Chip returned to his loft as the low afternoon sunshine was casting orange
rectangles across his elegantly distressed flooring.  The floors may have just
been old, but the landlord had insisted that they added authenticity to the
loft experience.  It wasn't clear what quality they were authenticating, but
Chip suspected that it was his gullibility that they proved more than anything
else.

As he took off his jacket, he slipped out his laptop and tried to make sense
of what all he had seen that day.  It seemed like it had been days since he
had sat on the tall stool at the kitchen counter ready to immerse himself in
the technicalities of embedded software and hardware development.  Now, here
he was at the end of the same day having talked to a widow, a corpse, and a
police officer and he didn't have much of anything to show for it.

A sophisticated computer hack had been discovered after breakfast time and
he had been completely distracted from that possibly gainful employment by his
curiosity on the topic of Don Mockson's apparently accidental death.  Mrs.
Mockson hadn't offered his curiosity much help, apart from her skepticism
about Mr. Mockson's emotional state at the time of his death.  The morgue
hadn't been nearly as revealing as it had been disturbing.  He had hoped for a
dramatic revelation of an undiscovered wound, but all he had found was a
slight discoloration.
