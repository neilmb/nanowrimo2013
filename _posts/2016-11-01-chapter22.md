Ellen looked surprised that Chip could somehow know what someone at the mining
company had looked at on her stoically frozen computer, but when Chip dived
behind the desk, she remembered the small computer that he had left behind
that was tapped into her network cable with the little throwing star-shaped
network tap and the nest of ethernet cables that swathed it.

From behind the desk Chip crowed "When I first got this traffic decrypted, I
just saw that it was video data that was streaming from your computer off over
the network to another computer somewhere else. That was all I needed to know
at the time about what was happening on your computer while you couldn't get
into it. But now, I should be able to reconstruct the video streams from the
sent packets and we can watch exactly what they were watching on their end."

Chip emerged from behind the desk with the little credit-card sized circuit
board that was a complete computer even though it looked more like something
that someone had forgotten to put away after the science fair.  He popped out
the thumbnail-sized memory card and grabbed an adapter out of one of his many
pockets that enfolded the memory card and gave it a plug on one of its ends
that could go directly into his laptop.  He extracted the laptop from the
lumbar pocket of his jacket and set it carefully on the desk as far as
possible from the charred remnants of the disk drives as if he didn't want his
laptop to get infected with their malefiscence.  He also didn't join the
wireless network in Ellen's basement for fear of getting tagged by the same
thing that had rendered her PC so outwardly uncommunicative.  Instead, he
paired his laptop with his phone so that its network traffic would go out over
the relatively anonymous endpoint that his cell phone provider maintained on
the public internet.

He needed the internet connection on his laptop because he had no idea how to
do what he had in mind. He tuned out Ellen who perched on the desk over his
shoulder and tuned in to a succession of web forums that led him to better
search terms which led him to more secretive web forums which had discussions
of programs related to what he wanted to accomplish. Finally, following the
online identities of some of the people who were participating in those web
forums, he tracked down other things that they had written online. (How many
different people would use the screen name "darkTrollNuts2345" to talk about
network traffic replay attacks?)

Chip didn't find anyone who talked about doing exactly what he had in mind,
but he saw some things that were close enough that Chip began to put together
a possible solution for taking the streams of tiny chunks of data that flowed
over a computer network and put them together into a video that could be
watched on the screen.  The basic idea of what he was going to try to do was
to set up a virtual computer inside of his laptop that would stand in for
their unknown adversary's computer that was receiving the network traffic. The
virtual adversary that Chip set up had its own virtual computer network inside
and Chip found a couple of tools that could take the packet captures that he
had on the tiny memory card and play them back into the virtual computer
network as if they were really happening.

It was sort of like setting up his own Matrix where the computer that lived
inside his laptop was being fed the exact information over the network that
had gone down the network to their adversary. If Chip could figure out how to
set the virtual computer up similarly enough to the real one on the other end,
he could feed it stimulation that would cause it to react in the same way that
the real computer would have in that situation. This was a type of what is
known as a "replay attack" where input is repeated over again for a nefarious
purpose. Most replay attacks were used for breaking various codes, but in this
case, the code had already been broken, but Chip and Ellen just wanted to see
a literal instant replay of what had been happening shortly before things got
crispy.
