Buck Lemaire jumped casually down from the cab of the pickup as Chip gripped
the steering wheel with white knuckles and Lurlene fumed aggressively. Buck
walked right up to the driver's side window and rapped on it with one knuckle.
Chip couldn't roll down the window because the battery was dead, so he had to
open the door and gesture at Buck to step back because he was about to swing
the little door open into Buck's crotch. Buck stepped back and Chip opened the
door and started to unfold himself from the small front seat.

"Looks like you folks could use some help," Buck Lemaire drawled lazily.

Chip had been bracing himself for some kind of physical altercation, hoping
that the few months of karate he had managed to endure after he graduated
college would stand him in good stead. So Buck's friendly manner took Chip
completely off guard and disarmed him, if he could ever have been considered
armed in the first place.

"Uh, yeah, I guess. It seems we're uh"—Chip chose the easiest expression—"uh,
out of gas."

"Well, I can help you with that, why don't you just jump in the truck and
we'll go get you some gas."

That kind offer was too much for Chip to just swallow, so he had to ask,
"Weren't you just trying to catch us?"

"'Course I was," Buck admitted without any trace of remorse. "I was looking
for you to help me out with my computer. You said you were some kind of IT
wizard when you dropped in on me uninvited."

Chip couldn't comprehend what he was hearing, so he had to gulp and ask more
stupid questions of his most ancient social enemy. "You, uh, you wanted some
help with you computer? That's why you followed us all the way across town?"
Chip asked guiltily.

"Sure, and it's a good thing I did. You two are miles from anything out here.
I mean, maybe you could flag down a combine or a farmer on his big tractor
putting down ammonia for next year's crop, but otherwise you were going to be
walking back to Fredrickton."

From the way he was talking, Chip almost expected Buck to drape his arm over
Chip's shoulders, but instead Chip draped a goofy grin on his face and leaned
down to see Lurlene in the passenger seat. "Hey good lookin'. I didn't get to
say goodbye to you last time we saw each other. Wanna go back to the office
so I can have another chance?"

Lurlene quickly controlled the sequence of angry and frustrated looks that
spun over her lovely features until she just looked plain lovely and she
turned to smile back at Buck. She replied coyly to his invitation with a bit
more than her usual country drawl, "Let's figure out how to get us out of here
first, okay? Then, who knows?" Thankfully for Chip she didn't wink at Buck
when she said it.
