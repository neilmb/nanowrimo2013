Chip felt doubly marked now, once as a vector of the community rights viral
meme and now once again as the nosy geek with no good cover story for poking
around in Buck Lemaire's business.  He kept glancing furtively over his
shoulder as he walked back to his loft.  As he turned onto his own block, he
had a panicked realization that if someone was following him, then they were
going to know where he lived.    He battled back the panic with the argument
that anyone who cared to know where he lived could have easily lifted that
information from various public records containing his name and address.

Chip steeled himself to breathe deeply and evenly as he opened his front door
and went up the distressed stairway, wondering if each of the scratched boards
he stepped on was going to be the one that triggered the pipe bomb hidden by
figures from the shadowy underworld.  He made it to the top of the stairs
unscathed and tried to survey his large, open-plan living space carefully.
As a natural slob, Chip had no idea if the half-empty chip bag that he left on
the counter had been tampered with by an interloper or not.

With one more shuddery deep breath, Chip plunged into the room, figuring that
since he had no chance of detecting any signs of an intruder among the general
mess, and since he couldn't spend all of his time suspecting his trash of
having surveillance capabilities, he was just going to have to try to get on
with his life.

So, like most males of his generation, the next step in getting on with his
life was checking all of the various messaging platforms that might be used to
contact him.  Some of them could be aggregated together by various third party
tools, but some were completely walled gardens where he had to make a separate
login to check on those messages.  As a result, it was almost 25 minutes later
that Chip got around to checking the actual voice recorded messages on his
phone line.  When he saw the indication that he had a new message, Chip
immediately knew that someone at least 10 years older than he was wanted to
talk to him.  Anyone younger than that would never have had the patience to
leave a voice message and just wait for a response, but instead would have
pestered him on half a dozen other platforms until they got his immediate
attention.

The older person who had left the message was Ellen Suffolk, who had left a
somewhat breathless and cryptic message that something had changed on her
computer and could Chip please come as soon as possible.  Closing his laptop
and slipping back in his jacket pocket, Chip charged back down the stairs
without even bothering to worry about pipe bombs and walked right down to
where his car was parked.

As he drove out the back side of town and up the winding road towards Ellen
Suffolk's house, Chip reviewed what he knew of her situation and what could
have changed that made her need to call him with some urgency.  Her files were
locked up behind strong encryption by someone who was using her network
connection to stream the videos that Ellen had taken recently around her own
house.  Chip didn't know what part of that had changed, but it must have been
something noticeable, or else she wouldn't have known to call him.

Chip was firmly mulling over the possibilities as he rounded the last curve
before the turn to go up Ellen's driveway.  Just a little bit lost in thought,
Chip didn't notice the large black pickup truck coming up behind him until he
couldn't even tell that it was black because the only thing he saw in his
rearview mirror was an enormous chrome grill.  Snapping our of his reverie,
Chip flinched when he saw the shiny enormity and briefly lost his grip on the
wheel.  The washboarded dirt road began to push the car wider and wider on the
right-hand curve until he was in the opposite lane when he regained control of
the wheel.

The truck stopped short of ramming him from behind and pushing him off the
road and down the steep banks of the creek.  Rather, the truck slid by close
by on the inside of the curve, gunning the engine as he squeaked by and
spraying Chip's car with a rain of road gravel.  The windshield took a couple
of rock dings with short radiating cracks, but none of the stony missiles shot
through into the passenger compartment, although Chip cowered down on the
center console as if he was taking gunfire.
