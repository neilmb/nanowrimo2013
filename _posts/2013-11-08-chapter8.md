When Chip got back to his apartment, he started digging through the small
number of moving boxes he had still possessed when he had driven back across
the country.  Two thirds of the boxes were full of various computer parts and
cables and what not, so it took him a while to come up with what he had been
looking for.  It was a small circuit board about the size of a credit card
that had a network jack, a power plug and a USB port and some incredibly tiny
chips soldered on.  A relative of the Raspberry Pi, this tiny circuit board
was a fully functioning computer.  It wasn't fast or pretty, but it could run
for a week on a nine-volt battery and the drivers could easily handle
the traffic on Ellen's aging network.

Chip gathered what he needed to turn this into a network sniffing device and
headed for the tall granite countertop that separated the kitchen from the
living room area.  Whoever renovated this loft probably thought of this as a
breakfast counter, but for Chip it was a great workbench for some embedded
computing experimentation.

Before he got anywhere near his zone, there was a knock at his door.
