The morning light streamed freely through the tall windows of Chip's loft
because the curtains he had bought at the thrift store yesterday were lying in
the trunk of his car where they weren't blocking out much of anything.  Waking
with the bright light, Chip remembered the most intense dream about a
honest-to-goodness debate, chanted slogans, and an unexpected death.  When he
noticed that he was in bed wearing the same clothes that he had worn last night, he
groaned with the realization that truth was oftentimes stranger than dreams

As he stumbled through his normally automatic morning coffee ritual, he
thought lots about the recent past, but he also thought about the near future.
What exactly does one do the day after witnessing a death?  What happens to

The voice messages were fewer and from more familiar people, but were more
interesting as a result.  One was from Lurlene who had left with the first
wave of guilty, lucky cowards and wanted to make sure that Chip had made it
home and was feeling okay.  The second message was from Ellen Suffolk thanking
him for all of his efforts and wanting to know where to send him a check.

Tackling these in decreasing order of triviality, he began with a call back to
Ellen.  He figured that if he left a voice message, he could just give her the
address and be done with it.  Instead, she answered the phone right away and
asked him if he would be willing to
